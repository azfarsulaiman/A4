    <h2>Proposition: Globalization 2.0 (starting 2000) has been far more adverse for the Global South than the Global North. </h2>

      <h3>FOR the Proposition</h3>

					These visualizations present a nuanced perspective on the impact of the latest phase of globalization, particularly highlighting its unfulfilled promises, especially for the Global South. The data across different dimensions suggests that the benefits of globalization have been unevenly distributed:

					Shift in Income Sources (Top Left Panel): The panel indicates a significant trend towards secondary income sources over primary ones, with a notably negative net differential per capita. This trend is increasingly pronounced in lower middle and low-income countries in the Global South, suggesting that globalization may have led to a destabilization of traditional primary income sources in these regions.
				
					Refugee Populations (Top Right Dendogram): This dendogram breaks down the refugee populations by country of origin from the Global South, with a specific focus on the period coinciding with the War on Terror. This visualization provides a stark representation of the geopolitical upheavals and their impact on human displacement, particularly in the Global South.
				
					Global Female Workforce Share (Bottom Left Pie Charts): These charts compare the share of the global female workforce between two timeframes, 1970-1999 and 2000-2020, showing no significant change. This stagnation implies that the wave of globalization has not effectively translated into greater global workforce participation for women, a key indicator of gender equality and economic empowerment.
				
					Fertility Rate Trends (Bottom Right Bar Graph): This graph illustrates a decreasing step-wise trend in fertility rates worldwide since the 1970s. While this trend might reflect broader socio-economic changes, it also raises questions about the multifaceted impacts of globalization on family structures and personal choices.				</figcaption>

				Design Decisions and Rationale:
			</p>

			<ul>
				<li><b>Binning Items: (-0.5)</b> The categorization of countries into Global North and Global South, further segmented into high/middle-income groups for the Global North and low/lower-middle-income for the Global South, was done somewhat arbitrarily. This binning was intended to highlight extremes in trends. Additionally, the timeline of globalization was divided into two distinct periods: 2000-2020 and 1970-1999. This temporal binning facilitated a clearer comparison across time blocks, particularly in showcasing the evolution of female labor force participation. My hope with binning was to allow better comparison and segment countries into these buckets to understand how Globalization 2.0 has impacted certain areas.</li>
				<li><b>Choice of Colors: (1):</b> I carefully selected red in my visualizations to highlight the deteriorating situation in the Global South. The color red, often associated with danger or warnings due to its negative connotations, helps draw attention to the critical issues at hand, such as changing fertility rates and shifts in primary versus secondary income. Although these trends may not inherently signify societal decline, the color choice directs viewers to consider the potential negatives. Pink is used to align with user's mental models of female representation and contrasted with the grey, highlights the point more significantly that the share has remain unchanged practically over the years.</li>
				<li><b>Drop Effect (2):</b> To emphasize the declining situation, I employed a 'drop effect', complemented by "trickle-down" labels. This approach was integrated into bar graphs to depict a downward trend across countries and over time. I strategically arranged data in dendograms and income differential graphs to reinforce this effect. While this technique effectively communicates losses in areas like income and fertility rates, it also introduces confusion in refugee data by conveying a sense of loss even when the share is decreasing from a top-down read. In the fertility rate visualizations, I deliberately avoided smooth marks and encoding. This approach highlights a dramatic decrease in fertility rates more starkly. By necessitating that the viewer pay attention to both the finer details and the overall trend (the 'drop-effect'), the graphs more effectively convey the significant reduction. This method contrasts with what a smoother area graph might have shown, making the decline more visually impactful and emphasizing the urgency of the situation.</li>
				<li><b>Power-packed Labels (2):</b> Strategic label choices bolstered the portrayal of decline in the Global South. Phrases like "Trickle Down", "Decreasing", "War on Terror", and "Informal" add emotional weight to the visuals, guiding the audience's interpretation. Although the "War on Terror" contributes significantly to refugee crises in the Global South, its juxtaposition with the broader negative impacts of globalization intensifies the overall message. In the axis, although the data variable is Adolescent Fertility Rates (15-19), I changed this to "Fertility Rates" to produce an overall effect of declining social indicator even though it the drop in adolescent fertility rates may be a good ting and that women are enjoying greater rights.</li>
				<li><b>Excluding Information and Proactive Use of Space: (1)</b> I leveraged space effectively, omitting data on high-income countries from the Income Differential graph to avoid clutter and highlight their positive primary income contribution. In the Fertility Rate graph, the use of white space starkly contrasts the halving of fertility rates over the period, drawing focus to this significant trend.</li>

      <h3>AGAINST the Proposition</h3>

      <figure>
				<img src="images/Dashboard 2.png" alt="Globalization has improved situation" width = 860, height = 770/>
				<figcaption>
					This visualization effectively illustrates the positive developments in various social indicators since the onset of what is labeled as Globalization 2.0, starting around 2000. It highlights the progress made, particularly in the Global South, across several key areas:

					School Enrollments (Top Left Area Chart): This chart showcases a rising trend in both primary and secondary school enrollments in the Global South, with a notable surge observed during the late 1990s and early 2000s. This increase indicates significant strides in educational attainment, suggesting improved access to education.
				
					Refugees Claiming Asylum (Top Right Maps): A comparison of asylum claims in developed countries during two periods, 1970-1999 and 2000-2020, shows a substantial decline in the latter. This reduction could be interpreted as an outcome of improved conditions in the Global South or changes in global refugee policies.
				
					Women in Parliament (Bottom Left Box-and-Whisker Plots): These plots reveal that the percentage of women in parliament in lower-middle-income countries of the Global South is approaching that of their high-income counterparts. Interestingly, upper-middle-income countries in the Global North have seen a relative decline, indicating that the Global South has experienced more significant progress in gender representation in politics.
				
					Female Labor Force Participation (Bottom Right Line Graph): The line graph demonstrates that women in the higher participation percentiles in the Global South's poorer groups have consistently maintained higher levels than their counterparts in the Global North. This trend suggests that women in the Global South have been relatively more successful in advancing economically within their respective income brackets.

				Design Decisions and Rationale:
			</p>

			<ul>
				<li><b>Bins: (0.5)</b> I employed similar data binning tactics in this visualization as I did previously, but this time to argue against the initial proposition. By grouping countries and years into specific bins, I was able to effectively compare and contrast different segments. This method facilitated a clearer presentation of contrasting trends across various groups, allowing me to convey my opposing viewpoint more convincingly. This strategic binning plays a crucial role in guiding the audience's understanding and interpretation of the data in line with the new argument.</li>
				<li><b>Labels (1.5):</b> I employed wording with positive connotations to advocate that globalization has improved the situation in the Global South. The title "Positive Outlook" sets a tone for the entire visualization, influencing the reader's interpretation from the outset. Terms like "improving" and "rising" further reinforce this positive narrative. This strategic use of language aims to guide the viewer's perception towards seeing globalization as a beneficial force, shaping the overall message conveyed by the data. The data variables were truncated or changed  to remove extraneous information. The Avg School Primary and Secondary employment variable has information removed to prevent providing additional context to readers. </li>
				<li><b>Deceptive Use of Trend Lines(2):</b> The School Enrollment graph features a misleading trend line. Despite a notable decline in school enrollment starting in 2016, the trend line misleadingly suggests an increase. The graph's subtle yellow color contrasts with the trend line's dominant, high-contrast black, drawing attention away from the actual data and falsely implying a positive trend where it does not exist. Additionally, in the Female Labor Force Participation graph, I employed a trend line to suggest that, from 2000 to 2020, the participation rate has remained steady in low-income countries in the Global South, while it has been relatively low in high-income countries of the Global North. This use of trend lines strategically manipulates the viewer's perception, shaping their understanding of the data to fit a particular narrative. </li>
				<li><b>Manipulation of Labor Force variable (2)</b> In my analysis, I deliberately selected the 95th percentile of the "Average Value of Female Labor Force Participation" to find a trend that aligned with my argument. This choice of a specific percentile, rather than a more comprehensive or average measure, allowed me to illustrate a particular narrative: that women in the 95th percentile have a higher representation in the Global South compared to countries in the Global North. This selective representation of data can be seen as a strategic maneuver to strengthen my point, even though it may not accurately reflect the overall situation of female labor force participation across all income levels. </li>
				<li><b>Shifting Attention in Map Comparisons (-0.5)</b>  In the visualization, I intentionally utilized a map-wise representation of North American and Western European countries with specific color and size encodings. This design was chosen to lead viewers to conclude that refugee asylum claims have decreased during the Globalization 2.0 era (2000-2020) compared to the period from 1970-1999. The layout encourages readers to make comparisons, with a focus on the data for the USA, which stands out prominently. However, this approach somewhat masks the fact that, in countries like Canada and Turkey, asylum claims have actually increased. The use of a color gradient from red to green and the size encodings are meant to convey a sense of situational improvement and direct the viewer's attention to specific parts of the map. Moreover, the chosen zoom level of the map intentionally obfuscates details in European countries, thereby hindering accurate engagement with the data and focusing attention predominantly on the USA. This selective representation and emphasis potentially lead to a skewed understanding of the overall refugee trends. </li>
