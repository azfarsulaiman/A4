    <h2>Proposition: Globalization 2.0 (starting 2000) has been far more adverse for the Global South than the Global North. </h2>

      <h3>FOR the Proposition</h3>

					Visualizations depict how across various dimensions, the new wave of globalization hasn't involved the drastic improvements it had promised, especially for the Global South.
					The top left panel shows that there has been a shift towards secondary income sources compared to primary ones as the net differential is <b>extensively negative</b> per capita, increasingly more pronounced for Lower Middle and Low Income countries in the Global South.
					This top right dendogram breaks down the Refugees populations from coutnry of origin from the Global South, coinciding also with the War on Terror.
					The bottom left pie charts depicts no significant change in share of global female workforce across two timeframes, 1970-1999 and 2000-2020.
					The bottom right bar graph shows a decreasing step-wise trend in fertility rates across the world sicne 1970s  <i>Source: World Bank's Poverty and Economic Growth datasets. </i>

				Design Decisions and Rationale:
			</p>

			<ul>
				<li><b>Binning Items: (-0.5)</b> The categorization of countries into Global North and Global South, further segmented into high/middle-income groups for the Global North and low/lower-middle-income for the Global South, was done somewhat arbitrarily. This binning was intended to highlight extremes in trends. Additionally, the timeline of globalization was divided into two distinct periods: 2000-2020 and 1970-1999. This temporal binning facilitated a clearer comparison across time blocks, particularly in showcasing the evolution of female labor force participation. My hope with binning was to allow better comparison and segment countries into these buckets to understand how Globalization 2.0 has impacted certain areas.</li>
				<li><b>Choice of Colors: (1):</b> I carefully selected red in my visualizations to highlight the deteriorating situation in the Global South. The color red, often associated with danger or warnings due to its negative connotations, helps draw attention to the critical issues at hand, such as changing fertility rates and shifts in primary versus secondary income. Although these trends may not inherently signify societal decline, the color choice directs viewers to consider the potential negatives. Pink is used to align with user's mental models of female representation and contrasted with the grey, highlights the point more significantly that the share has remain unchanged practically over the years.</li>
				<li><b>Drop Effect (2):</b> To emphasize the declining situation, I employed a 'drop effect', complemented by "trickle-down" labels. This approach was integrated into bar graphs to depict a downward trend across countries and over time. I strategically arranged data in dendograms and income differential graphs to reinforce this effect. While this technique effectively communicates losses in areas like income and fertility rates, it also introduces confusion in refugee data by conveying a sense of loss even when the share is decreasing from a top-down read. In the fertility rate visualizations, I deliberately avoided smooth marks and encoding. This approach highlights a dramatic decrease in fertility rates more starkly. By necessitating that the viewer pay attention to both the finer details and the overall trend (the 'drop-effect'), the graphs more effectively convey the significant reduction. This method contrasts with what a smoother area graph might have shown, making the decline more visually impactful and emphasizing the urgency of the situation.</li>
				<li><b>Power-packed Labels (2):</b> Strategic label choices bolstered the portrayal of decline in the Global South. Phrases like "Trickle Down", "Decreasing", "War on Terror", and "Informal" add emotional weight to the visuals, guiding the audience's interpretation. Although the "War on Terror" contributes significantly to refugee crises in the Global South, its juxtaposition with the broader negative impacts of globalization intensifies the overall message. In the axis, although the data variable is Adolescent Fertility Rates (15-19), I changed this to "Fertility Rates" to produce an overall effect of declining social indicator even though it the drop in adolescent fertility rates may be a good ting and that women are enjoying greater rights.</li>
				<li><b>Excluding Information and Proactive Use of Space: (1)</b> I leveraged space effectively, omitting data on high-income countries from the Income Differential graph to avoid clutter and highlight their positive primary income contribution. In the Fertility Rate graph, the use of white space starkly contrasts the halving of fertility rates over the period, drawing focus to this significant trend.</li>

      <h3>AGAINST the Proposition</h3>

      <figure>
				<img src="images/Dashboard 2.png" alt="Globalization has improved situation" width = 860, height = 770/>
				<figcaption>
          This visualization depcits that scnearios have been improving over the years, especially since the 2000 which has been lablelled the era of Globalization 2.0. 
		  It can be observed that across various social development indicators, the Global South has either done better or caught-up fast with the Global North.
		  The top left area chart displays how the trend of school enrolments in primary and secondary schooling has increased, with a significant jump seen around the late 1990s/ early 2000s.
		  The top right maps compare the refugees claiming asylum in the developed world in 1970-1999 and 2000-2020 time periods, showing a significant reduction in the latter.
		  The bottom left box-and-whisker plots show that percntage of women in parliament in Lower Middle Income countries in Global South have come closer to their high Income countrerparts, followed by Global South's Low Income countries. In fact, the Upper Middle Income countries in Global north have done worse, indicating that Global South has seen a bigger improvement.
		  The bottom right line graph shows that females in the higher percentile fo the Global SOuth's poor income groups have manage to remain at hgiher levels than their Global North counterparts.

				Design Decisions and Rationale:
			</p>

			<ul>
				<li><b>Bins: (1)</b> I employed similar data binning tactics in this visualization as I did previously, but this time to argue against the initial proposition. By grouping countries and years into specific bins, I was able to effectively compare and contrast different segments. This method facilitated a clearer presentation of contrasting trends across various groups, allowing me to convey my opposing viewpoint more convincingly. This strategic binning plays a crucial role in guiding the audience's understanding and interpretation of the data in line with the new argument.</li>
				<li><b>Labels (1.5):</b> I employed wording with positive connotations to advocate that globalization has improved the situation in the Global South. The title "Positive Outlook" sets a tone for the entire visualization, influencing the reader's interpretation from the outset. Terms like "improving" and "rising" further reinforce this positive narrative. This strategic use of language aims to guide the viewer's perception towards seeing globalization as a beneficial force, shaping the overall message conveyed by the data. </li>
				<li><b>Deceptive Use of Trend Lines(2):</b> In the School Enrollment graph, I intentionally used a trend line to obscure and mislead the viewer about the actual situation. Despite a significant decrease in school enrollment beginning in 2016, the trend line suggests an upward trajectory. This misrepresentation is further accentuated by using a subtle yellow color for the graph itself, but a more dominant, high-contrast black for the trend line. This choice deliberately diverts attention away from the actual data, falsely indicating a positive trend where there is none.</li>
				<li><b>Manipulation of Labor Force variable (2)</b> I purposefully chose the 95th percentile of the "Average Value of Female Labor Force Participation" </li>
				<li><b>Side-by-side comparison (-1)</b></li>
			</ul>

      <h2>Final Reflection</h2>

      <p>This was a really interesting assignment which provided me the opportunity to explore the World Bank datasets in full depth.</p>
